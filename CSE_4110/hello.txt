Problem Statement 
 
2.1 Problems 
Rupali banks, Savings accounts are bank accounts that allows to hold money and earn some interest, but also have access to the money in the event when anyone needs cash in a pinch. Savings accounts aren’t invested in the market, so the value won’t go down, also it has some problems like – 
• Low interest 
Though savings account gives opportunity to store money and have some interest from it. Also take out the money from account when needed, holding all money in a savings account probably isn’t best option because of the disadvantages of savings accounts. Savings accounts will typically pay more interest than checking accounts, but not as high a rate of return as you can achieve in other types of accounts like. For example, if anyone have money that he/she knows he/she won’t need for a certain period of time, he/she can usually attain a higher interest rate on a certificate of deposit. That means, savings account is a great place to save safe money. but not a great place for money to grow over the long term. 
 
• Withdrawal restriction 
Savings accounts of this bank aren’t as flexible when it comes to moving money as checking accounts. Anyone can deposit money in a savings account as often as want, but banking regulations restrict to six pre-authorized, automated, or telephone transfers or withdraws during any given month. But anyone can also do as many transfers as you want to pay a loan at the same bank. 
 
• Online experience is hard to use 
If anyone wants to know about current status of his/her savings account, it is very hard to know about it. Though, Rupali Bank provides some messaging facility to notify about transaction but, there are many banks who offers great interfaces and apps for customers. 
 
2.2    Feasibility Report 
This feasibility study report is a formal proposal. Objective of our feasibility study is not to solve the problem but to acquire a sense of its scope. So, this is a formal document detailing the nature and scope of the proposal solutions. 
 
2.2.1   Major questions of feasibility study that we followed 
 
•       What are the users demonstrable needs and how does a candidate system meet them? 
•       What resources are available for given candidate systems? Is the problem worth solving? 
 
2.2.2   Feasibility study 
 
•       What are the users demonstrable needs and how does a candidate system meet them? 
 
Rupali Bank has an annual interest rate of 3-3.5%. It is relatively lower than some existing non-government banks. This is an issue in case of inspiring new users to start a new savings account. 
Moreover,  the online services of the bank and the mobile banking system is also limited by only deposit and withdrawal. This system should be more digitalized to ensure more user engagement.  
On top of that, without MICR check or an ATM card, it is not possible to withdraw money from any branch of Rupali bank other than the specific branch from which the account was created. This creates a substantial issue on user experience leading to inconveniency of withdrawal. As a result the bank fails to make a solid user base among middle class and lower class. 
A proper online mobile banking can eliminate these obstacles  from the system. 
 
•       What resources are available for given candidate systems? Is the problem worth solving? 
 
Rupali bank has undergone major changes in most of the branches. Most of the branches has been digitalized, made compatible for online banking and online services. So, it is safe to say that the bank currently possesses enough resources to tackle the ongoing problems.  
In any service-based company it is a must to maintain user satisfaction.   The issues of incompatibility in case of withdrawal of money from any branch of the bank is a major point of inconvenience for a vast number of users. Also the physical attendance of the user in order to withdraw also can be considered as a red flag in case of user satisfaction.  So, it is definitely a worthy problem to solve for the given candidate system. 
 
•       What are the likely impacts of the candidate system on the organization? 
 
The problems of the current system of Rupali Bank have been found out. As an analyst we proposed  a new system which is supposed to be an effective system by ensuring the solution of the problems of  existing system. This new system can cooperate with the customers in a more effective and friendly way.  People will be more encouraged to follow this system. An outline of the method sand procedures  undertaken by the existing system, followed by coverage of the objectives and procedures of the candidate  system. As an analyst we can say that the impact of the candidate system on the organization will be  better more than the previous condition. 
 
 
 
2.2.3    Summary of findings and recommendations 
 
•       Low interest rate – It ca be solved by increasing some interest rate like other non-government bank is doing now. 
 
•       Mobile Banking system facilities are limited – Mobile banking system should be improved and developed. Because, now adays people feels troublesome withdraw money from bank when they immediately need it. People also don’t want to spend money for atm card services. 
 
•       Trust issues – Savings and banking system also have some trust issues among lower and middle-class people. This issue may be solved by creating a method. Where a target amount will be provided to the users. Submission of this target amount of money, user can get small exciting gifts from bank. After fulfilling this target user can have his/her new target for exciting gifts. This method may be motivate peoples to open a savings account and saves money also remove trust issues. 
 
 
2.3 Conclusion 
We have tried to portrait the system of saving account sections of Rupali Bank Ltd Motijheel branch and discuss different problems in this system from our point of view.  Also tried to give some recommendation for its improvement. 
 
 
Chapter 3 
Information Analysis 
 
System analysis totally depends on the analysis of information about the existing system so that we can find out the problems and the procedure to manage the solution. As an analyst, the information we need are about the organizations, user staff and the workflow. It will help us to identify its goals, purposes and create systems and procedure that will achieve them in an efficient way. To start the process of information analysis , we need to gather the information from different aspects.  
 
3.1 Information gathering 
Information can be gathered in several phases. For example, information can be gathered through available documentation, such as procedures manual, documents and their flow, interviews of the user staff and on-site observation. 
 
3.1.1       Information Gathering Tools: 
 
We believe, information gathering tools help the analysts to assess the effectiveness and disadvantages  of the current system and provide the groundwork for recommending a candidate system. Also the proper use of tools for gathering information  is the key to successful analysis. There are several tools for gathering information like Review of literature, procedures and forms, Onsite observation, Interviews and questionaries. 
 
Review of literature, procedures and forms - 
Procedure manuals and forms are useful sources for the analyst. They can describe the format and functions of the present system. The manual always describe how well the system is designed. Up-to-date manuals save hours of information gathering. For getting information of Rupali Bank, we have checked the website, searched the services they provide and check the reviews of their services. 
According to thei debit card service they said, “A customer having a deposit account with the designated branch of Rupali Bank Limited can get a ATM card. 
Instead customer is welcome to apply for an ATM card to the branch where he/she is maintaining an account. Issuing charge (one time) is Tk. 300 only and yearly charge is Tk. 200 only. 
Ther customer will be provided with ATM card and PIN within 7 (seven) days from the date of application. Customer can use his/her card at any ATM of Rupali Bank – BRAC Bank booths or with logo `Omnibus’ and ‘Q-Cash’. 
Customer can withdraw any amount multiplied by Tk. 500 per instance subject to fulfillment of the above conditions i.e. Tk. 500 (Taka Five hundred), Tk. 1000 (Taka One thousand) Tk. 2000 (Taka Two thousand), Tk. 3000 (Taka Three thousand) and maximum Tk. 20,000 (Taka Twenty thousand) per instance and maximum withdrawl limit Tk. 50,000 (Taka Fifty thousand) per day.” 
Beside this, customer can have  Mobile Financial Service (MFS) using a app named SureCash. SureCash is a Mobile Financial Service (MFS) network offering a hosted mobile banking and payment services involving banks, NGOs, mobile network operators and payment affiliates such as utility companies, merchants/retailers, employers, insurance organizations and government departments. Besides making sure that customer's cash stays safe, and they get convenient payment and mobile recharge options, the primary advantage of SureCash is that the platform is multinetwork and inter-bank. This gives customers the flexibility to use any mobile operator to use the services of any bank that has signed up on the SureCash network. 
But unfortunately the customer reviews on this app are much worse. In most cases, this app is much faultier and buggier. There are many issues in this app such as; 
•       Authentication lagging, 
•       Self registration is not user friendly, 
•       Account activation process is too slow, 
•       OTP matching problem, 
•       Network Connection issues 
•       Recharginh issues 
•       Unneccessary options 
•       UI is not good as customer desired 
•       Not user friendly etc 
We collect some of this customer review from google play store. Three screenshots about app review and ratings are given below. 
 
 
Figure 3.1: Screenshots about SureCash Application and user’s poor reviews. 
 
Interviews and Questionnaires - 
At first we thought we would collect information from the branch manager in person at the bank. But we couldn't do it because of Covid Pandemic. Later, we were able to arrange an online meeting with Assistant General Manager Hasina Sultana. But due to his illness we can’t continue our interview for a long time. Our official interview conversation with the Assistant General Manager is given below

Question: Would you please tell us what are the withdrawal procedures from this bank? 
Answer: Using an ATM Card one can easily withdraw money from any ATM Booth of any Bank at all the time — 24/7. But the withdrawal charge varies based on the amount. 
 
3.1.2       Information Summary: 
 
It was not easy for us to collect information because of Covid Pandemic but we have collected some information about the savings account to the best of our ability Most of the time we have to face various privacy issues while collecting information. So that we could not collect most of the information related to the savings account money flow investment percentage and investment place. Much of our collected information covers how a customer deals with a savings account and what his experiences are like. However, a summary of the information we have collected is given below 
•       Rupali Bank gives 3% interest rate to savings account and 1000tk is minimum to have an account. 
•       Rupali Bank doesn’t use bkash transaction for deposit or withdraw money. 
•       Rupali Bank System has an app named ‘SureCash’ but we have checked out the reviews. The feedback is too poor to consider. 
•       Web banking system is open but this is neither well-known nor user friendly. 
•       ATM Card is not for lifetime. One should pay to keep it and withdrawal process also have charges on amount of money. 
•       On the other hand, without ATM card, one should go to the Rupali bank branches for withdrawing money. 
 
3.2   Structured Analysis 
To make a system understandable to the users, structured analysis is followed. It’s a set of techniques and graphical tools that allow the analyst to develop an understandable system specifications. The traditional approaches have many drawbacks, and so the analyst needs something analogous to the architect’s blueprint as a starting point for system design. It is the way to focus on the functions, not on the physical implementation. There are so many tools for it like- Data Flow Diagram, Data Dictionary, Structured English, Decision Trees and Decision Tables, but as an analyst we will focus on the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) first and then with the help of the table we will then explain the data flow diagram of the existence system. 
 
3.2.1    Data Flow Diagram of existing Savings Account System 
A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any process or system. It uses defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows, short text labels- to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the routes between each destination. Data flowcharts can range from simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to indepth, multi-level DFDs that dig progressively deeper into how the data is handled. A DFD methodology is quite effective and it is easy to understand after a brief orientation. The diagram gives analysts practical scope to work efficiently at time of the specification and analysis of requirements

Description of the DFD of the existing system - 
The Data Flow Diagram shows us the three main activities related to saving’s account system of Rupali Bank. Here below are the used symbols meaning for our diagram: 
1.    Squares define the source and destinations: Customers and their accounts. 
2.    Arrows identify the data flow- data in motion. It’s the pipeline through which information flows. It describes how a process goes on to meet the goal. 
3.    Circle represent a process that transform incoming data flows into outgoing data flows. The three major process are: Check Current Status, Deposit Money and Withdraw Money and all the process are used to complete this major activities. 
4.    Rectangle is a data store- data at rest or a temporary repository of data. Here we have used four rectangles to represent data storage: Account Information, All Transaction Information, All requests for Deposit process and All requests for Withdrawal process. 
 
  
3.2.2      DFD Elaboration 
This data flow diagram mainly denotes how a customer goes through any system for his three main essential tasks. In this section, we will elaborate Data Flow Diagram described above by the process, storage and data flow that we have used and find out problems.
