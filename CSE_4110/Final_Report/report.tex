thorough examination of Tech Rajshahi and providing valuable information for decision-making.
We will explore each information gathering tool in detail in the sections that follow, discussing its
significance and practical applications in Tech Rajshahi analysis.
\subsection{Information Gathering}
One of the most important steps in evaluating and analyzing the potential system for Tech Rajshahi Ltd. is gathering information about the current system.  For an analysis to be successful, information collection instruments must be used effectively.  Conventional methods of information collection include surveys, on‑site observations, and interviews.  With the use of these tools, analysts can assess the current system’s efficacy and gain knowledge for creating a proposed candidate system.

Information is gathered via a variety of sources and techniques over multiple stages.  These include interviewing user staff members, conducting on‑site observations, and reviewing the existing documentation, such as procedure manuals, documents, and data flows.  To perform a thorough study of Tech Rajshahi, the analyst must gather data in three primary areas: the organization’s goals, objectives, and structures; the people who use the current system; and the workflow within the system.

The first area of information collection involves understanding Tech Rajshahi’s policies, aims, objectives, and organizational structure.  Examining policies helps determine how the system operates as policies are converted into rules and procedures that facilitate goal achievement.  The organization’s statement of goals acts as benchmarks for fulfilling the broader mission, demonstrating its commitment to its aims.  Furthermore, understanding the organizational structure of Tech Rajshahi provides insights into the goals and priorities of management.

The second area of information collection focuses on the people who are essential to the operation of the current system.  The analyst should prioritize understanding personnel roles, authority dynamics, work statuses and responsibilities, information needs, and interpersonal interactions.  Acquiring this information enables the analyst to identify relevant parties and establish efficient communication pathways.

The third and final area of information collection addresses the workflow of the system.  The goal of workflow analysis is to comprehend the various points in the system where data flows.  A Data Flow Diagram (DFD), which depicts the flow of data and the interactions between various system components, can be used to visualize this. 

By tailoring the information collection procedure to Tech Rajshahi’s unique setting, the analyst can gain a comprehensive understanding of the company, its personnel, and its workflow.

Data Dictionaries offer detailed descriptions of data elements and their usage, ensuring consistency.  Process specifications document each process’s inputs, outputs, and transformations.  Flowcharts visualize the sequence of operations, aiding in understanding workflows and logic.  These tools collectively facilitate systematic and effective system analysis and design.

\subsection{Data Flow Diagram (DFD)}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) visually represents the flow of data within a system, showcasing how inputs are processed into outputs through various functions and interactions.  In this report, the DFD illustrates the movement of data between different components of Tech Rajshahi’s operations, including project management, employee assignment, and client service.  By detailing data sources, processes, and destinations, the DFD provides a clear map of how data is handled and transformed, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of system operations and aiding in the identification of potential improvements or inefficiencies.

\subsubsection{Overview of the Present System}
DFDs provide a graphical representation of the system, making it easier to understand and communicate the flow of data and processes involved.  They serve as documentation for the system, capturing the essential processes, data stores and flows, which can be useful for future reference, maintenance, and enhancements.  By analysing the DFD, it becomes easier to identify the system’s requirements, including the processes, data sources, and data destinations.

To present the project management workflow of \company{Tech Rajshahi Ltd.} in a structured manner, the DFD is presented in multiple levels.  At the highest level (Context Diagram), the system is treated as a single process interacting with external entities.  The Level~1 diagram decomposes the system into its major functional components, while Level~2 diagrams expand each major process into its constituent sub‑processes.  Each figure below is accompanied by a brief description to aid interpretation.

\subsubsection{Context Diagram}
\noindent
The context diagram provides a high-level view of the Project Management System.  Here the system is represented by a single process that accepts project requirements from the Client and produces a completed project. The system also interfaces with a WORK RECORD data store for tracking resources and project status.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Context Diagram of Tech Rajshahi's Project Management System}
    \label{fig:context_dfd}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Level 1 DFD}
The Level~1 DFD decomposes the Project Management System into six major processes. Sequentially, these processes take a project from conception to completion:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process of Sourcing (1.0):} Collects project requirements from the client, checks the availability of resources and, if feasible, stores the project information for further processing.
    \item \textbf{Skill Matching to the Project (2.0):} Retrieves employee information and matches their skills with the requirements of the project.
    \item \textbf{Training Employee for the Project (3.0):} Initiates training when an employee’s skills do not meet the project requirements.
    \item \textbf{Assigning and Scheduling Tasks (4.0):} Assigns tasks to appropriate employees and schedules work based on project needs.
    \item \textbf{Checking for Completion of Project (5.0):} Verifies task completion, reviews project deliverables, and prepares the project for handover.
    \item \textbf{Handing Over the Project (6.0):} Compiles final deliverables, obtains client acknowledgement and updates the work records to mark the project as complete.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:level2_process1}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Process 2.0 – Skill Matching to the Project-}
\noindent
In this stage, the system extracts employee information (Process 2.1) and compares employee skills with project requirements (Process 2.2). A mismatch directs the flow to training; otherwise, it proceeds to task assignment.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:level2_process2}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1.8cm}
\subsubsection*{Process 3.0 – Training Employee for the Project-}
\noindent
If a skill gap is identified, employees undergo training. The sub-processes include training employees (Process 3.1), updating employee information (Process 3.2), and returning the skilled employee back to the matching stage (Process 3.3).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{Level 2 DFD – Process 3.0: Training Employee for the Project}
    \label{fig:level2_process3}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Process 4.0 – Assigning and Scheduling Tasks-}
\noindent
After matching and training, the system selects skilled employees (Process 4.1), assigns tasks and schedules work (Process 4.2), and stores project and employee information (Process 4.3) in the work record.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:level2_process4}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1.8cm}
\subsubsection*{Process 5.0 – Checking for Completion of Project-}
\noindent
Here the system extracts work records (Process 5.1), verifies project completion and proofing (Process 5.2), and sends the completed project to the handover process (Process 5.3) if it meets quality standards.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Decision Tree}
A decision tree is a visual tool used in decision‑making and predictive modelling.  It represents decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.  Structured like a tree, it starts with a root node representing the initial decision, splits into branches representing different choices or outcomes, and ends with leaf nodes showing the final decisions or results.  Decision trees are valuable for evaluating different strategies and predicting outcomes by quantifying risks and benefits.  They simplify complex decision‑making processes by breaking them down into manageable, sequential steps, enhancing clarity and strategic planning.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Fig/DT.png}
        \caption{Decision Tree for Tech Rajshahi}
    \label{fig:decision_tree_tech}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:decision_tree_tech} illustrates a comprehensive project management lifecycle, guiding decisions from project initiation through closure.  It begins by evaluating project feasibility and alignment with company goals, then assesses resource sufficiency.  The tree branches based on whether milestones are met, client satisfaction with deliverables, and the need for post‑implementation support.  It offers alternative paths for various scenarios, including adjusting plans, renegotiating terms, or even rejecting the project if necessary.  The process emphasizes adaptability, allowing for resource adjustments, hiring or training new talent, or outsourcing when needed.  Throughout, it focuses on client satisfaction and effective resource management.  The tree concludes with either providing ongoing project support or officially closing the project, ensuring a thorough approach to project management that addresses potential challenges and outcomes at each stage.

\subsection{Decision Table}
A decision table is a crucial tool in system analysis that helps systematically evaluate complex
decision-making scenarios. By presenting conditions and corresponding actions in a structured
tabular format, decision tables enable analysts to clearly visualize and assess the impact of different
inputs on system outputs. This organized approach not only simplifies the analysis of various
scenarios but also aids in identifying inconsistencies, redundancies, and gaps in decision logic.
The importance of decision tables lies in their ability to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible
conditions, improve decision accuracy, and enhance communication among stakeholders, ultimately
leading to more effective and reliable system design and implementation. This decision table
provides a systematic framework for making decisions at various stages of a project, from feasibility
assessment to closure. This tool allows Tech Rajshahi Ltd. to quickly evaluate different scenarios
and determine the appropriate actions, ensuring consistent and efficient project management across

\subsection{Financial Metrics Formulas}

To evaluate the financial viability of each candidate system, we use the following formulas:

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{1. Payback Period (PP):}

The payback period measures how long it takes to recover the initial investment from annual benefits.

$$\text{Payback Period (Years)} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Benefit}}$$

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent\textbf{2. Return on Investment (ROI):}

ROI indicates the profitability of the investment as a percentage of the initial cost.

$$\text{ROI (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Annual Benefit} - \text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Initial Cost}}\right) \times 100$$

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent\textbf{3. Cost–Benefit Ratio (CBR):}

The cost-benefit ratio compares total benefits to total costs. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates benefits exceed costs.

$$\text{CBR} = \frac{\text{Total Benefits}}{\text{Total Costs}}$$

\vspace{2cm}
\noindent\textbf{Calculation for Candidate System 1:}

\begin{align*}
\text{Payback Period} &= \frac{8,00,000}{8,00,000} = 1.0 \text{ year} \\[0.3cm]
\text{ROI} &= \left(\frac{8,00,000 - 8,00,000}{8,00,000}\right) \times 100 = 0\% \text{ (first year)}\\
&\text{After second year: } \left(\frac{7,00,000}{8,00,000}\right) \times 100 = 87.5\% \\[0.3cm]
\text{CBR} &= \frac{8,00,000}{8,00,000} = 1.0 : 1.0 \text{ (first year)}\\
&\text{Over 2 years: } \frac{14,00,000}{8,00,000} = 1.0 : 1.75
\end{align*}

\newpage

\noindent\textbf{Calculation for Candidate System 2:}

\begin{align*}
\text{Payback Period} &= \frac{12,00,000}{14,50,000} = 0.83 \text{ years (approx. 10 months)} \\[0.3cm]
\text{ROI} &= \left(\frac{14,50,000 - 12,00,000}{12,00,000}\right) \times 100 = 20.8\% \text{ (first year)}\\
&\text{After second year: } \left(\frac{14,50,000}{12,00,000}\right) \times 100 = 120.8\% \\[0.3cm]
\text{CBR} &= \frac{14,50,000}{12,00,000} = 1.0 : 1.21 \text{ (first year)}\\
&\text{Over 2 years: } \frac{26,50,000}{12,00,000} = 1.0 : 2.20

This diagram illustrates the interactions between external entities, internal processes, data stores, and the flow of information that enables seamless project management, resource allocation, and decision‑making.

Figure~\ref{fig:dfd_system_design} presents the complete data flow architecture of Candidate System 2, showcasing the integration of AI‑driven components with traditional project management workflows.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Fig/dfd_candidate_system2.png}
\caption{Data Flow Diagram for AI-Powered Project Management System (Candidate System 2)}
\label{fig:dfd_system_design}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Components of the DFD:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{External Entities:} The system interacts with four primary external entities—\textit{Clients}, \textit{Employees}, \textit{Management}, and \textit{AI Services}.  Clients submit project requests and receive deliverables, progress reports, and invoices.  Employees interact with the system to receive task assignments, update work status, and access training resources.  Management uses the system for strategic oversight, performance monitoring, and decision‑making.  AI Services provide machine learning capabilities for task assignment optimization, predictive analytics, and automation.

    \item \textbf{Core Processes:} The DFD identifies several interconnected processes that form the backbone of the system.  The \textit{Project Initiation Process} captures client requirements and creates new project records.  The \textit{AI‑Based Task Assignment Process} analyzes employee skills, project requirements, and historical data to automatically assign tasks to the most suitable team members.  The \textit{Progress Tracking Process} monitors task completion, milestone achievements, and resource utilization in real‑time.  The \textit{Billing and Invoice Generation Process} automatically calculates project costs based on time logs and generates invoices.  The \textit{Quality Assurance Process} collects feedback, runs automated tests, and generates quality reports.  The \textit{Predictive Analytics Process} uses AI models to forecast project risks, resource bottlenecks, and timeline deviations.

    \item \textbf{Data Stores:} The system maintains six critical databases that store persistent information.  The \textit{Project Info} database stores all project‑related details including titles, timelines, budgets, and status.  The \textit{Employee Info} database maintains employee profiles, skills, roles, and performance records.  The \textit{Resources} database tracks hardware, software, and infrastructure allocation.  The \textit{Work Record} database logs time spent on tasks, deliverables submitted, and activity histories.  The \textit{Feature Store} database maintains engineered features and metadata for machine learning models.  The \textit{Model Registry} database stores trained AI models, their versions, parameters, and performance metrics.

    \item \textbf{Data Flows:} Data flows are represented by labeled arrows indicating the movement of information between entities, processes, and data stores.  For example, clients send project requirements to the Project Initiation Process, which then stores project details in the Project Info database.  The AI‑Based Task Assignment Process reads from both Project Info and Employee Info databases, processes the information through AI Services, and writes assignments to the Work Record database.  Progress updates flow from employees through the Progress Tracking Process and update multiple databases including Work Record and Project Info.  Management receives consolidated reports and analytics that draw data from all six databases through the Predictive Analytics Process.

    \item \textbf{AI Integration:} A distinguishing feature of this DFD is the explicit representation of AI‑driven processes.  The AI‑Based Task Assignment Process leverages the Feature Store to access pre‑computed features and the Model Registry to retrieve trained assignment models.  Similarly, the Predictive Analytics Process uses historical data from all databases, applies machine learning models, and generates insights about project health, risk factors, and optimization opportunities.  This AI integration enables proactive management and data‑driven decision‑making, setting Candidate System 2 apart from traditional project management systems.

    \item \textbf{Feedback Loops:} The DFD incorporates several feedback mechanisms that enable continuous improvement.  Employee performance data feeds back into the AI models to refine future task assignments.  Quality assurance results influence project planning and resource allocation.  Client feedback is captured and analyzed to identify patterns and improve service delivery.  These feedback loops ensure that the system learns and adapts over time, becoming more efficient and accurate.
\end{itemize}

The data flow architecture demonstrated in this diagram ensures seamless coordination between human actors and AI‑powered automation, maintaining data consistency, supporting concurrent operations, and enabling real‑time visibility across all organizational levels.  The modular design allows for independent scaling of components and facilitates future enhancements without disrupting existing workflows.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Data Design}
The system employs a well‑structured relational database schema (based on MySQL or PostgreSQL) to manage interconnected data across various modules.  Core entities include \texttt{Client}, \texttt{Project}, \texttt{Invoice}, \texttt{Employee}, \texttt{Task}, \texttt{Assignment}, \texttt{Feedback}, and \texttt{QAReport}.  Referential integrity is maintained using primary and foreign key constraints, ensuring consistency and eliminating redundancy.

The database follows normalization principles (up to 3NF) to maintain efficiency and scalability.  Relationships such as "one‑to‑many" between clients and projects or "many‑to‑many" between employees and tasks are implemented using junction tables.  An Entity–Relationship (ER) diagram visually represents these associations, simplifying database maintenance and future system upgrades.

Furthermore, indexing and query optimization techniques are used to enhance system performance, especially under heavy workloads.  The data model also incorporates version control for audit trails and ensures compliance with international data protection standards.

\subsubsection{Interface Design}
The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are designed with an emphasis on simplicity, responsiveness, and accessibility.  The front end is developed using modern web technologies such as \textit{React} or \textit{Vue.js} with \textit{Bootstrap} or \textit{Tailwind CSS}, ensuring a clean, modern layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

\end{itemize}

This infrastructure design guarantees that Tech Rajshahi's system can support both on‑site and remote work environments, aligning with the company's flexible work policy and future scalability plans.

\subsubsection{Database Implementation}
The system uses a \textbf{MySQL} or \textbf{PostgreSQL} database optimized for concurrent operations and heavy query loads.  The database schema follows normalization principles (up to 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.

Key technical features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimized Indexing:} Composite indexing on frequently queried fields and query caching improve performance for analytical queries and report generation.
    
    \item \textbf{Encryption:} Sensitive data, including employee details, financial transactions, and client credentials, are encrypted both \textit{at rest} and \textit{in transit} using AES‑256 encryption.
    
    \item \textbf{Replication:} A master‑slave replication setup ensures real‑time data synchronization and disaster recovery readiness.  The slave server can immediately take over in case of primary server failure.
    
    \item \textbf{Backup Automation:} Automated scripts schedule daily incremental backups and weekly full backups, with checksum validation to detect corruption.
    
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Tools:} Performance monitoring tools such as \textit{phpMyAdmin}, \textit{pgAdmin}, or \textit{Prometheus} are integrated for real‑time analytics and database health checks.
\end{itemize}

The database design supports multi‑user access while maintaining strict role‑based permissions to prevent unauthorized data exposure.  The use of cloud‑based replication also ensures zero downtime during scaling or maintenance operations.

\subsection{Functional Decomposition and Structured Chart}
A \textbf{Structured Chart} is a hierarchical diagram that represents the modular design of a system by breaking down complex functions into smaller, manageable components.  It illustrates the functional decomposition of the system, showing how high‑level processes are subdivided into lower‑level modules, and depicts the relationships, control flow, and data flow between these modules.  For Tech Rajshahi's AI‑Powered Project Management and Automation system, the structured chart provides a clear visualization of the system's architecture, demonstrating how different functional units interact to deliver the complete solution.

The functional decomposition follows a top‑down approach, systematically breaking down the system from the most abstract level (Level~0) to increasingly detailed levels (Level~1, Level~2, and Level~3), ensuring comprehensive coverage of all system functionalities.

\subsubsection{Level 0: System Overview}
At \textbf{Level~0}, the system is represented as a single high‑level module: the \textit{Proposed Tech Rajshahi System}.  This represents the entire system as a unified entity responsible for managing all organizational activities.  The system receives inputs including \textit{Client Inquiries}, \textit{Client Feedback and Requirements}, \textit{Operational Service Request}, and \textit{Project Deliverables Requirements}, and produces outputs including \textit{Financial Summary Report}, \textit{Project Deliverables Requirements}, \textit{Departmental Setup Report}, \textit{Support Result}, and \textit{Completed Project Records}.  Level~0 establishes the system's boundary and defines its primary purpose without revealing internal structure.

\subsubsection{Level 1: Major Functional Modules}
\textbf{Level~1} decomposes the top‑level system into five major functional modules, each representing a distinct area of responsibility:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Financial Management:} Manages all financial operations including transactions, reporting, budgeting, and billing activities.  It receives \textit{Payment Processing Request} as input and produces \textit{Report Output}, \textit{Budget Plan}, and \textit{Financial Analysis Result} as outputs.
    
    \item \textbf{Client Relationship Management:} Handles all client‑related interactions, requirements gathering, contract management, and payment processing.  It receives \textit{Client Inquiries}, \textit{Approved Response}, \textit{Payment Record}, and \textit{Job Offers} as inputs, and produces \textit{Client Request and Query Management} output.

\subsubsection{Structured Chart Representation}
Figure~\ref{fig:system_architecture} presents the structured chart for the AI‑Powered Project Management and Automation system, visually depicting the hierarchical decomposition from Level~0 through Level~3.  The chart uses standard notations: rectangles represent modules and components, connecting lines indicate control flow and module invocation relationships, and data flow arrows (with labels) show information exchange between modules.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Fig/Structured_Chart.png}
    \caption{Structured Chart of AI‑Powered Project Management System}
    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

The structured chart demonstrates how the main system controller coordinates between different modules, ensuring proper data flow and functional integration while maintaining modularity and maintainability.  The hierarchical structure facilitates understanding of system complexity, supports parallel development by multiple teams, enables independent testing of components, and provides a clear roadmap for implementation.  By following this structured decomposition, Tech Rajshahi ensures that the system architecture is scalable, maintainable, and aligned with software engineering best practices.

\subsection{Coupling and Cohesion}
In software design, \textbf{coupling} and \textbf{cohesion} are essential principles that determine the quality and maintainability of the system.

\subsubsection{Coupling}
Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules.  \textbf{Loose coupling} is desirable as it allows modules to be modified independently without affecting others.  Tech Rajshahi's system design achieves loose coupling through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Well‑defined APIs between modules.
    \item Use of message queues for asynchronous communication.
    \item Dependency injection patterns.
    \item Standardized data formats (JSON) for inter‑module communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cohesion}
Cohesion refers to how closely the responsibilities of a single module are related.  \textbf{High cohesion} is desirable as it ensures that each module has a clear, focused purpose.  The system design achieves high cohesion by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organizing modules around specific business functions (e.g., Project Management, Billing, AI Analytics).
    \item Ensuring each module handles only related tasks and data.
    \item Following the single responsibility principle.
    \item Minimizing module size and complexity.
\end{itemize}

By maintaining loose coupling and high cohesion, the system becomes more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

\subsection{Design Deliverables}
The system design phase produces several key deliverables that guide the implementation phase:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System Architecture Document:} Comprehensive documentation of the system architecture, including diagrams, technology stack, and infrastructure specifications.
