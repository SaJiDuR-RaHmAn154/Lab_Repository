\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Executive Summary}

This report documents a 10-day industrial attachment undertaken in a student team at \textcolor{companycolor}{\textbf{Netro Systems Limited}} from March 9, 2025, to March 20, 2025. The attachment aimed to integrate theoretical knowledge from my Computer Science and Engineering program with practical experience in a professional software development environment. During this period, we began with orientation sessions covering the company’s culture, services, and development processes. We were introduced to Agile \cite{ref8} methodologies and used Kanban boards to manage tasks within cross-functional teams. 

I contributed to a major project called \textcolor{projectcolor}{\textbf{\textit{Smart Pathshala}}}, a school management system, by assisting the development team with design, testing, and documentation tasks while adhering to credential access limitations. I also supported various development activities such as reviewing user interface designs, understanding backend API integration, and performing module-level testing. The work involved technologies like React \cite{ref3}, Node.js \cite{ref5}, and MongoDB for data storage. Over the course of the attachment, we participated in daily stand-up meetings, used Git for version control, and regularly presented progress updates to our mentors.


Through this attachment, I observed the organizational structure and operational processes of Netro Systems. Chapter 2 describes the company's history, mission, departments, and core services, including its emphasis on quality and a collaborative work culture. Chapter 3 provides a detailed overview of the Smart Pathshala project, covering the problem analysis, literature background, and development methodology. Chapter 4 outlines the tools and techniques used, such as development frameworks, version control, and testing tools. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss societal, safety, and ethical considerations encountered during the attachment, including workplace health measures, data privacy practices, and cultural awareness in design. Chapter 7 reflects on the technical and soft skills I gained, while Chapter 8 details the challenges I faced and the lessons learned. Chapter 9 summarizes my specific contributions to the organization, and Chapter 10 concludes with recommendations for the company, the university, and future interns.

Overall, the industrial attachment provided valuable hands-on experience in software engineering \cite{ref11}. I developed new technical competencies, improved problem-solving abilities, and gained insight into the professional responsibilities of an engineer. The recommendations and reflections in this report are intended to contribute to continuous improvement for all stakeholders involved in industrial training.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background of Industrial Attachment}
Industrial attachment (internship) is a mandatory component of the engineering curriculum at RUET. It bridges classroom learning and industry practice by exposing students to real-world engineering projects. Netro Systems Limited was selected for my internship due to its cutting-edge work in software development and diversified portfolio. The attachment provided an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, understand professional work environments, and fulfill degree requirements.

\section{Importance in Achieving Engineering Program Outcomes}
The attachment helped me bridge academic knowledge with industry practice. At Netro,
I observed how teams design and deliver end-to-end software solutions, including UI/UX
design, SaaS platforms, and AI-driven applications. The hands-on experience ensured that skills such as software design, coding, and testing were practiced to industry standards.Also observing an management system project allowed me to apply data-driven
problem-solving and core engineering principles to a practical task. 

\section{Objectives of the Attachment}
The primary objectives of this attachment were:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item To gain practical experience in a professional software development setting.
    \item To contribute to a real project (Smart Pathshala) and implement technical solutions.
    \item To learn and apply software engineering \cite{ref11} tools and practices used at Netro Systems.
    \item To enhance understanding of the software development lifecycle, teamwork, and communication.
    \item To develop soft skills such as problem-solving, adaptability, and professional responsibility.
\end{coloritemize}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The attachment focused on software development tasks within the Smart Pathshala project. Scope included backend and frontend development, database design, and user interface implementation. Due to time constraints (10 days), I did not engage in
long-term tasks like deployment or system maintenance. My role was mainly supportive,
but I still gained a broad overview of full-stack development

\section{Methodology}
The project followed an Agile \cite{ref8} Development methodology with iterative sprints. I participated in requirement analysis meetings and helped create user stories and prototypes using Figma. Two-week sprint cycles were employed: each cycle involved planning, development, testing, and review. Version control (Git) and code reviews maintained quality. I also performed continuous self-study (reading documentation, online tutorials) to learn new tools as needed. Methodologies for software design (MVC architecture) and testing (unit and integration tests) were used to ensure a systematic approach.

\section{Workplace Safety and Environmental Policy}
Netro Systems operates primarily in an office environment with standard safety measures. Offices are equipped with fire extinguishers and clearly marked emergency exits. New employees receive basic safety training, including fire drills. Given the sedentary nature of software work, ergonomic furniture (adjustable chairs, monitor stands) is provided to prevent strain injuries. Hygiene practices (sanitized desks, clean facilities) are enforced, contributing to a healthy work environment. For remote work, employees are given guidelines for safe home office setup. Environmentally, the company encourages electronic documentation to minimize paper use. Idle hardware is powered down when not needed, and e-waste is responsibly recycled. By using cloud hosting (e.g. AWS \cite{ref7}) instead of heavy local servers, Netro reduces its physical energy footprint. During my attachment, I also promoted paperless workflows in the Smart Pathshala project (e.g. digital report cards), supporting the company’s sustainability mindset.

\chapter{Project Work and Activities}

\section{Project Title and Description}
During my industrial attachment at Netro Systems, Rajshahi, I had the opportunity to learn about one of their major software products named \project{Smart Pathshala} \cite{ref2}. It is a school
management system designed to simplify academic and administrative tasks for schools,
colleges, and coaching centers in Bangladesh.
Smart Pathshala digitalizes traditional school operations such as attendance, exam
results, teacher management, accounts, student records, and communication between
teachers, guardians, and students. It includes a web portal and Android app, making it
easier for teachers and parents to access information anytime.
The main aim of this system is to reduce paperwork, save time, and increase trans-
parency between schools and parents.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Figures/smart_pathshala.png} \caption{Smart Pathshala}
\end{figure}

\section{Problem Identification \& Complexity Analysis}
Many local schools in Bangladesh rely on paper records and disconnected spreadsheets, leading to errors and inefficiency. The core problem was the lack of a centralized information system: attendance data had to be manually entered multiple times, fee records were difficult to reconcile, and communication between teachers and parents was slow. From a technical perspective, the project’s complexity included handling multiple user roles (administrators, teachers, parents, students) each with specific permissions and interfaces. The system needed real-time updates (e.g. instant notifications for absences), multilingual support (English and Bengali), and high data security (protecting student information). Ensuring scalability (for many concurrent users) and data consistency across modules added further complexity.

\section{Literature Survey and Background}
The developers studied global school management systems such as Fedena, MySchool, and OpenEduCat, but found them unsuitable for small local schools due to high cost and system complexity. They also analyzed existing educational management practices in Bangladesh—especially in rural areas—and identified key functional and contextual requirements such as:

\begin{coloritemize}
    \item Bangla-language interface to ensure inclusivity and usability among local educators and administrators.
    \item Offline access support to enable continued operation during internet outages, a common issue in remote areas.
\end{coloritemize}

Hence, \project{Smart Pathshala} was designed as a localized, user-friendly, and affordable solution tailored specifically for Bangladeshi educational institutions.


\section{Problem-Solving Approach}
The development of Smart Pathshala followed an \textbf{Agile \cite{ref8} Methodology} with iterative sprints. Our approach included:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Requirement Analysis:}} We documented user stories (e.g., “As a teacher, I want to record daily attendance so that I can track student presence”) and defined the project scope accordingly.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Prototyping:}} We created wireframes and UI mockups in Figma for key modules (attendance dashboard, enrollment forms). These prototypes were reviewed by actual teachers and administrators for feedback before coding.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Sprint Planning:}} Work was divided into two-week sprints. Each sprint targeted a set of features – for example, one sprint developed the student registration module, another implemented the attendance management interface.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Iterative Development:}} Backend APIs (built with Node.js) and frontend components (React) were developed in tandem. After each sprint, we delivered a working demo to stakeholders for validation.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Continuous Feedback:}} Feedback from teachers and the project team was incorporated after each iteration. For example, early user tests led to UI improvements (streamlining form fields) and adjusting notification frequency.
\end{coloritemize}

\section{Experiment/Design Methodology}
The system architecture was designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The backend (controller/model) runs on Node.js \cite{ref5} with Express framework and connects to a MongoDB database. The frontend (view) is built with React.js \cite{ref3} for the web portal and React Native for the mobile app, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Key elements of our methodology included:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Design Models:}} We created UML diagrams and database schema designs early in the process to define data entities (students, classes, attendance records) and relationships (one-to-many, etc.).
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Version Control:}} All source code was managed with Git on GitHub. We used feature branches and pull requests; changes were peer-reviewed before merging into the main branch.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Testing:}} Unit tests were written using Jest for backend logic and React components. End-to-end tests using Postman(for APIs) and React Testing Library (for UI) helped catch integration issues early. 
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Hosting \& Deployment:}} AWS \cite{ref7} Cloud for stability and scalability; Docker for containerization.
\end{coloritemize}

\newpage
\section{Validation of Findings}
\label{sec:validation}
\project{Smart Pathshala} was tested in several schools located in Rajshahi and Dhaka to evaluate its usability, performance, and overall effectiveness. The key findings from the pilot implementation are summarized below:

\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Reduced manual work:}} Attendance and exam results could be entered within minutes, significantly reducing administrative workload for teachers.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Higher accuracy:}} Automated report generation minimized human errors and ensured consistent data recording.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Better communication:}} Parents could instantly view their children’s attendance, fee status, and exam results through the mobile application, improving engagement.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Positive user feedback:}} Teachers found the interface intuitive and user-friendly, while parents appreciated real-time updates and transparency.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Performance:}} The system efficiently handled thousands of student records without noticeable lag, validating its scalability and robustness.
\end{coloritemize}

Overall, \project{Smart Pathshala} proved to be an effective and reliable school management solution tailored to the context of Bangladeshi educational institutions.

\section{Application in Solving Complex Problems}
These tools were instrumental in solving engineering challenges. For example, React’s component-based structure made it easier to manage complex UIs (e.g. reusing form components for student and teacher dashboards). MongoDB’s query flexibility allowed generating reports (like monthly attendance) directly via its aggregation framework. Git branching enabled team members to work on different features (attendance vs. grading) concurrently without conflict. CI pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) automatically ran tests on every commit, quickly alerting us to integration issues before they could affect other parts of the project.

\newpage
\section{Limitations and Constraints}
Every tool had some constraints, such as-
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textbf{\tool{Scalability:}} While MongoDB scales well, it required careful indexing as the number of records (students, attendance entries) grew. We experienced slower queries initially until indexes were optimized.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Learning Curve:}} As an intern, learning both Node.js and React from scratch was challenging, delaying initial productivity. This was mitigated by team mentorship and online resources, which rapidly improved my proficiency.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Third-party Integrations:}} Integrating external APIs (e.g. SMS gateway for notifications) introduced dependency management issues (version conflicts). We handled this by using npm and thorough testing to catch conflicts early.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Testing Tools:}} Setting up the testing infrastructure (Jest, Selenium) required upfront configuration. Although time-consuming at first, this investment paid off by catching defects early in development.
\end{coloritemize}

\section{Simulation and Testing Tools}
To verify system performance and correctness, we used:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textbf{\tool{Postman}:} For manual API testing. I simulated requests from different user roles (teacher, admin, parent) to verify correct responses and error handling.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Jest \&}} \textbf{\tool{Enzyme}:} For automated unit testing of backend logic and React components. These tests were configured to run on every pull request.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Docker}:} Used to create containers replicating the production environment. This ensured consistency between my local setup and the deployment server, minimizing “it works on my machine” issues.
    \item \textbf{\tool{Apache JMeter}:} Performed basic load testing on our APIs. The system handled anticipated concurrent user loads smoothly, confirming our scaling strategy for a school setting.
\end{coloritemize}

\chapter{Societal, Health, Safety, Legal \& Cultural Considerations}
\section{Workplace, Health and Safety Measures}
During my attachment at Netro Systems, Rajshahi, I observed that the company main-
tains a professional and safe working environment. The office followed standard health
and safety practices to ensure employee well-being.\\
The workspace was clean, well-lit, and air-conditioned, with comfortable seating suit-
able for long hours of computer work. Developers often spend most of their time sitting
in front of screens, so ergonomic chairs and adjustable desks were provided to prevent
back and neck pain. The team encouraged short breaks to reduce eye strain and improve
concentration.\\
Senior-junior bonding has been found out quite a good unlike the others in Bangladesh.
There is no separate working desk for senior and junior worker of a single team. Rather,
all of them sit together and share their valuable knowledge while working. Boys and girls
members have given separate workspace so that they can work comfortably.\\
Safety measures included accessible fire extinguishers, organized electrical wiring to
avoid hazards, clearly marked emergency exits, and visible safety instructions. Hand
sanitizers were available at every corner, especially important after the COVID-19 period.
Digital safety was also emphasized. Each workstation had antivirus software, and
internet usage was monitored to prevent cybersecurity risks. The internal Wi-Fi network
was protected with password authentication to avoid unauthorized access to company
files.

\section{Legal Compliance in Engineering Activities}
\company{Netro Systems Limited} strictly follows all legal and regulatory guidelines relevant to software development and data management in Bangladesh. Before initiating any project, the company executes a formal legal deed with the client, clearly defining deliverables, timelines, intellectual property rights, and update or maintenance responsibilities. Confidentiality is a core value—project information is never shared with external parties without authorization.

For \project{Smart Pathshala}, which involves sensitive student data, the company implemented several legal and ethical compliance measures to ensure data protection and integrity:

\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{skillcolor}{\textbf{Licensed and open-source tools:}} All software tools and libraries used were either properly licensed or open-source with permissible usage rights.
    \item \textcolor{skillcolor}{\textbf{Data privacy and security:}} Sensitive data, including student profiles and fee records, were encrypted using secure algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.
    \item \textcolor{skillcolor}{\textbf{Confidentiality agreements:}} All clients and collaborators signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to maintain confidentiality of proprietary information.
    \item \textcolor{skillcolor}{\textbf{Controlled data access:}} Internal data access policies strictly limited who could view or modify production databases, ensuring accountability.
\end{coloritemize}

These practices demonstrate that professional software engineering \cite{ref11} extends beyond technical development—it encompasses ethical, legal, and regulatory responsibilities to safeguard user data and intellectual property.

\section{Societal, Cultural Awareness in Solution Design}
Netro Systems' global client base requires deep understanding of diverse cultural contexts and societal needs. During my attachment, I observed how the company integrates cultural sensitivity into solution design:

\subsection{Cross-Cultural Design Considerations}

\end{coloritemize}
Smart Pathshala’s design was influenced by societal and cultural factors. For example, the interface supports both English and Bengali languages to accommodate local users. Recognizing diverse levels of digital literacy, the UI was kept clean and intuitive (large buttons, clear icons). We aligned the school calendar with local norms (incorporating regional holidays). During development, I realized that understanding the user’s cultural context is key: for instance, notifications and reports avoided culturally sensitive content, and color choices were made with local preferences in mind. This cultural awareness improved user acceptance of the solution.

\section{Environmental Sustainability Considerations}
Netro Systems is conscious of environmental impact in its operations. The company uses cloud hosting (AWS \cite{ref7}) rather than on-site servers, reducing hardware energy usage. Idle servers and devices are powered down when not needed. E-waste (old laptops, hard drives) is recycled through approved channels. Internally, digital documentation is encouraged over printing. While working on Smart Pathshala, we also promoted paperless practices in schools (e.g. electronic report cards and notices), indirectly contributing to sustainability by saving paper. These practices reflect an understanding of the environmental footprint of software systems.

fessional software development. In the Smart Pathshala project, several ethical concerns
needed attention. The system stores sensitive student and school information, including
attendance, academic records, and financial details. Therefore, maintaining data privacy
and confidentiality was a top priority.\\

Developers were instructed not to access or view real user data unless necessary for
debugging. Every action involving production data required prior permission from the
project manager. Ethical behavior also meant not copying code or using third-party
software without proper licenses. A regular meeting in a week is conducted to educate
the team members about all of the concerning matters and it shows how Netro System
takes importance regarding this issue.\\

I also learned about ethical coding practices — writing clean, readable code, avoiding
shortcuts that could cause future problems, and documenting properly. All these steps

\newpage
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Honesty:}} Team members maintained transparency about project progress, challenges, and outcomes, ensuring truthful communication with clients and supervisors.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Accountability:}} Developers accepted responsibility for mistakes or system issues, working collaboratively to identify root causes and implement corrective actions.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Fairness:}} Equal opportunities were provided to all team members, with recognition based on merit and contribution rather than hierarchy or personal bias.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Respect:}} Clients, users, and colleagues were treated with courtesy, and their feedback was valued in decision-making processes.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Integrity:}} Software was developed and delivered with authenticity, avoiding false claims, plagiarism, or unethical manipulation of deliverables.
\end{coloritemize}

Every intern and employee at \company{Netro Systems Limited} was expected to uphold these standards. During meetings, I observed that team members consistently avoided exaggeration and reported the actual status of work, even when delays occurred. This culture of honesty and transparency built a strong sense of trust and professionalism within the team.


\section{Intellectual Property and Confidentiality}
Netro Systems maintains strict confidentiality of client information. All code and documentation were stored in secured repositories with controlled access. I treated all project materials (code, designs, data) as proprietary. Intellectual property issues were managed by using properly licensed libraries (avoiding unlicensed code) and by clear contracts ensuring any custom work done by interns belongs to the company. This clear IP framework meant I focused on innovation without concerns about ownership.

\section{Ethical Decision-Making Examples}
An example of ethical decision-making occurred when I discovered an unlicensed third-party code snippet in one of our dependencies. I immediately reported it to my supervisor. Together, we replaced it with a fully open-source alternative and documented the change, avoiding any infringement. In another instance, deciding how much personal data to collect was an ethical consideration: I limited data fields to only what was essential, respecting privacy principles. These decisions show applying ethical reasoning in engineering tasks.
