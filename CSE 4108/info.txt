\chapter{Project Overview}
\section{Comprehensive Project Portfolio}
Netro Systems has developed an impressive portfolio of major projects across diverse industries. The following sections detail key projects with their descriptions, features, and technologies. These case studies illustrate the company’s capabilities and inform best practices for the Smart Pathshala project.

\section{Project Title and Description}
The project undertaken during my attachment was titled \project{Smart Pathshala: School Management System}. \project{Smart Pathshala} is an integrated platform designed to streamline the administrative and academic processes of schools. Key features include student enrollment, attendance tracking, exam scheduling, grade and report management, fee processing, and a communication portal for teachers, parents, and students. The objective of the project was to replace fragmented manual processes with a unified, user-friendly application, increasing efficiency and transparency in school management.

\section{Problem Identification and Complexity Analysis}
Many schools in the region relied on paper records and disconnected spreadsheets, leading to errors and delays in data processing. The core problem was the lack of a centralized system, causing administrative burden and poor communication. From a technical perspective, the project’s complexity involved handling multiple user roles (administrators, teachers, parents, students) each with different permissions and interface needs. Additionally, the system needed to manage real-time updates (such as instant notifications for attendance or announcements) and ensure data consistency across modules. Security was also critical, as the system deals with minors’ personal information, necessitating careful access control and data protection.

\section{Literature Survey and Background}
To develop an effective solution, we studied existing Student Information Systems (SIS) and educational management platforms. Many successful systems use cloud-based architectures to allow remote access by all stakeholders. We reviewed academic papers on EdTech solutions and best practices for user-centered design in school software. Meetings with school administrators provided practical insights into local requirements, such as supporting multilingual interfaces (English and Bengali) and generating required reports for educational boards. This background work helped define the functional requirements and design considerations for Smart Pathshala.

\section{Problem-Solving Approach}
The development of Smart Pathshala followed an \textcolor{techcolor}{\textbf{agile methodology}} with iterative development cycles. The approach included:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Requirement Analysis:}} Listing user stories (e.g., “As a teacher, I want to record daily attendance so that student attendance is tracked”) and mapping the project scope.
    \item \textcolor{secondaryblue}{\textbf{Prototyping:}} Creating wireframes and UI mockups using \tool{Figma} to visualize key modules (e.g., dashboard, attendance interface). We presented these prototypes to teachers and administrators for feedback before coding.
    \item \textbf{Sprint Planning:} Dividing work into short sprints. For example, one sprint focused on the student registration module, another on attendance management, and so on.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Development:} Implementing features step by step. Backend APIs (Node.js) and frontend components (React) were developed in tandem. After each sprint, a working version was demonstrated to stakeholders for validation.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Feedback:} Incorporating feedback from users who tested early versions. This allowed us to refine the interface and add usability improvements (such as streamlined form flows and bilingual support).
\end{coloritemize}

\section{Experiment/Design Methodology}
The system architecture was designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The backend (controller/model) runs on \textcolor{techcolor}{\textbf{Node.js}} with Express and connects to a \textcolor{techcolor}{\textbf{MongoDB}} database for data storage. The frontend (view) is built with \textcolor{techcolor}{\textbf{React}} for the web interface and React Native for a mobile app, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Key elements of the methodology included:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Models:} UML diagrams for database schema and data flow charts were created during the initial design phase to ensure all components were well-defined.
    \item \textbf{Version Control:} We used Git for source control. All code was committed to GitHub with feature branches, and changes were merged after peer review.
    \item \textbf{Testing:} Unit tests were written in Jest to validate backend functions and frontend components. End-to-end testing with Postman and React Testing Library helped catch integration issues.
    \item \textbf{Deployment:} A staging environment on \textcolor{accentblue}{\textbf{AWS Elastic Beanstalk}} allowed testing of each sprint’s deliverable. After approval, the feature was deployed to the production environment on AWS EC2.
\end{coloritemize}

\section{Validation of Findings}
We validated the project progress through user acceptance tests and performance metrics. In two pilot schools, the application reduced attendance recording time by approximately 50\%. Data accuracy improved, as teachers reported fewer errors in grade calculations. Feedback surveys indicated that parents appreciated real-time notifications (e.g., automated alerts sent after 3 absences). These positive outcomes confirmed that the design and implementation effectively solved the initial problems. Any defects found during UAT were promptly fixed in subsequent sprints, ensuring the system met the stakeholders’ standards.

\end{coloritemize}

\section{Selection Criteria and Justification}
Each tool was selected based on project requirements and best practices:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textbf{Node.js and React:} Chosen for their widespread use in modern web development, strong community support, and efficiency in building dynamic user interfaces and APIs. They align with Netro Systems’ expertise in JavaScript ecosystems.
    \item \textbf{MongoDB:} Its schema-less design allows quick adjustments to the database structure, accommodating evolving requirements without costly migrations. This was important for iteratively adding new features (e.g., a new report field).
    \item \textbf{GitHub:} As a centralized code repository, it enabled seamless collaboration among developers. The platform’s issue tracking and pull request workflow facilitated agile development.
    \item \textbf{Jira:} Provided visibility into project progress, helped manage changing priorities, and kept the team aligned on sprint goals.
    \item \textbf{Figma/Adobe XD:} These tools allowed rapid sharing of UI designs and gathering feedback. Their cloud-based collaboration features meant that designers and developers could co-author designs in real-time.

\end{coloritemize}

\section{Application in Solving Complex Problems}
These tools played key roles in solving engineering challenges. For instance, React’s component-based structure made it easier to manage complex interfaces by reusing components for student and teacher dashboards. MongoDB’s flexible querying simplified generating reports (such as monthly attendance) directly from the database. Using Git branches allowed team members to work on different features (e.g., attendance vs. grading modules) concurrently without interference. Automated tests via Jenkins alerted us immediately to any failures, enabling quick correction of issues before they impacted other parts of the project.

\section{Limitations and Constraints}
Every tool had some constraints:
\begin{coloritemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} While MongoDB is scalable, we needed to plan indexing carefully as the student population grows. Initially, some queries became slow until we added appropriate indexes.
    \item \textbf{Learning Curve:} Learning Node.js and React simultaneously as an intern was challenging. This delayed initial development tasks. However, this was mitigated by team support and online tutorials, accelerating my proficiency.
    \item \textbf{Third-party Integrations:} Integrating external services (like an SMS API for notifications) introduced dependencies that occasionally conflicted with other libraries. We resolved these by managing dependencies with npm and thorough testing.
    \item \textbf{Testing Tools:} Setting up testing frameworks required additional configuration effort. The initial setup of Jest and Cypress took time, but automated tests ultimately reduced manual QA workload and increased reliability.
\end{coloritemize}

\begin{coloritemize}
    \item Developed the \project{teacher attendance module} for \project{Smart Pathshala}, including backend APIs for recording attendance and frontend forms for data entry. This feature enabled automated notifications to parents for absent students.
    \item Implemented a \project{fee management interface}, enabling accountants to generate invoices and record payments. My implementation included form validation and PDF generation for receipts.
    \item Wrote \skill{unit tests} for core backend functions, which helped reduce bugs by catching errors early in development.
    \item Assisted in migrating the project documentation to an internal wiki, making it easier for future developers to understand system architecture and setup.
\end{coloritemize}
These contributions increased the functionality and reliability of the Smart Pathshala system and supported the team’s overall progress.

\section{Improvements and Implementation}
Observing repetitive manual tasks in data handling, I proposed adding a CSV upload feature for bulk student registration. I created a prototype that was adopted by the team, significantly saving time during onboarding new students. I also suggested stricter code linting rules to improve code consistency; the team integrated my recommendation by configuring ESLint with a common style guide.

\section{Feedback from Supervisors}
My supervisors provided positive feedback on my initiative and quality of work. The industrial supervisor noted that the attendance feature I implemented met the clients’ expectations and was delivered on time. My academic supervisor commented that the objectives of the industrial attachment were successfully achieved through my active participation. Both supervisors highlighted my teamwork and willingness to learn, which they considered strong points of my performance.
