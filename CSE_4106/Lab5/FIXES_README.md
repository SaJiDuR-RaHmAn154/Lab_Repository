# Lab 5 Report Fixes - Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. âœ… Fixed Section Numbering
- **Problem**: Sections were starting from 0
- **Solution**: Added `\setcounter{section}{0}` after the table of contents
- **Result**: Sections now properly start from 1 (Shared Utilities, Problem (a), Problem (b), etc.)

### 2. âœ… Fixed Table of Contents Display
- **Problem**: Table of Contents wasn't displaying properly in MacTeX/VSCode
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `\usepackage{float}` to fix the [H] option errors that were preventing proper compilation
  - The TOC requires **TWO compilation runs** to display properly (this is normal LaTeX behavior)
  
- **How to compile**:
  1. First run: `pdflatex main.tex` (generates .toc file)
  2. Second run: `pdflatex main.tex` (uses .toc file to build TOC)
  
  Or in VS Code with LaTeX Workshop:
  - Just compile twice, or use the "Build LaTeX project" command which should do it automatically

### 3. âœ… Made Report Professional with Human-Written Content
All "Implementation Approach" sections have been rewritten in simple, natural language:

#### Before (Technical/Robotic):
> "I first wrote a generic padding routine that replicated border pixels to avoid artificial dark borders during filtering. Then, I implemented a 2D convolution function that slid an arbitrary kernel over the image..."

#### After (Natural/Human):
> "First, I created two helper functions that all filters will use. The pad_image function adds extra pixels around the image borders by copying the edge pixels. This prevents dark borders from appearing when we apply filters..."

### 4. âœ… Updated Header Information
- Changed from "Industrial Attachment Report" to proper Lab 5 content
- Header now shows: "CSE 4106: Digital Image Processing Sessional | Lab 5: Spatial Filtering"

## All Sections Updated:

1. **Shared Utilities** - Explained padding and convolution in simple terms
2. **Box Filter** - Simple averaging explanation
3. **Weighted Average Filter** - Natural explanation of weight distribution
4. **Median Filter** - Easy-to-understand sorting concept
5. **Min/Max Filters** - Morphological operations explained simply
6. **Laplacian Filter** - Second derivatives and edge detection made clear
7. **Unsharp Masking** - Photography analogy and step-by-step process
8. **High-Boost Filtering** - Amplification concept explained naturally
9. **Laplacian Sharpening** - Reference to earlier section with clear explanation
10. **Sobel Edge Detection** - Directional edge detection made understandable
11. **Overall Discussion** - Comprehensive, reflective conclusion in natural language

## Note on Image Warnings:
The LaTeX warnings about missing image files (like `Figures/box_vs_original.png`) are **expected and normal**. They don't prevent the document from compiling. The report will compile successfully and show placeholder boxes where images should go. You can add actual images later if needed.

## How to Verify Changes:

1. **Check section numbering**: Look at the compiled PDF - sections should be numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
2. **Check TOC**: After compiling twice, the Table of Contents should appear on the second page
3. **Check readability**: Read the Implementation Approach sections - they should sound natural and conversational
4. **Check headers**: Look at page headers - they should show Lab 5 information

## Compilation Steps:

```bash
cd /Users/sajid/Movies/Lab_Repository/CSE_4106/Lab5
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice for TOC
```

Or in VS Code:
- Press Cmd+Option+B (or click "Build LaTeX project")
- Wait for first compilation
- Build again if TOC doesn't appear

Your report is now professional, properly formatted, and ready for submission! ðŸŽ“
