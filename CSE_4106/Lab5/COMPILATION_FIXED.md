# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## Summary of Fixes Applied:

### 1. ✅ Document Class Fixed
- **Problem**: Document class was set to `article` instead of `report`
- **Solution**: Changed `\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}` to `\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{report}`
- **Result**: Document now uses correct report class with proper chapter/section structure

### 2. ✅ Header Height Warning Fixed
- **Problem**: `\headheight` was too small (15pt), causing warnings on every page
- **Solution**: Increased from `headheight=15pt` to `headheight=25pt`
- **Result**: No more headheight warnings during compilation

### 3. ✅ Section Numbering Fixed
- **Problem**: Sections were starting from 0 instead of 1
- **Root Cause**: The `\setcounter{section}{0}` was placed BEFORE the unnumbered experiment title section
- **Solution**: Moved `\setcounter{section}{0}` to come AFTER the unnumbered title section
- **Result**: Sections now properly numbered starting from 1

## Current Document Structure:

```

├── 1. Shared Utilities
├── 2. Problem (a): Mean (Box) Filter
├── 3. Problem (b): Weighted Average Filter
├── 4. Problem (c): Median Filter
├── 5. Problem (d): Min and Max Filters
├── 6. Problem (e): Laplacian Filter
├── 7. Problem (f): Unsharp Masking
├── 8. Problem (g): High-Boost Filtering
├── 9. Problem (h): Laplacian-based Sharpening
├── 10. Problem (i): Sobel Edge Detection
└── Overall Discussion and Conclusion (unnumbered)
```

## Compilation Status:

- ✅ **PDF Generated**: `main.pdf` (24 pages, ~299 KB)
- ✅ **No Structural Errors**: All LaTeX structure is correct
- ⚠️ **Expected Warnings**: Missing image files (Figures/*.png) - these are normal and don't prevent compilation
- ✅ **Table of Contents**: Will display properly after second compilation run

## How to Compile:

### Option 1: In VS Code with LaTeX Workshop
Just click "Build LaTeX project" or press the keyboard shortcut

### Option 2: In Terminal
```bash
cd /Users/sajid/Movies/Lab_Repository/CSE_4106/Lab5
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice for TOC
```

### Option 3: Using latexmk (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/sajid/Movies/Lab_Repository/CSE_4106/Lab5
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

## Note on Missing Images:
The warnings about missing `Figures/*.png` files are expected. The document will compile successfully with placeholder boxes where images should appear. You can add actual figure images later if needed by:

1. Creating a `Figures` directory: `mkdir Figures`
2. Saving screenshots from your Jupyter notebook as PNG files in that directory

Your report is now properly formatted and ready! 🎉
