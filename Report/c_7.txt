It tracks both outgoing and incoming payments, ensuring accuracy and transparency. The module also supports multiple currencies and payment gateways to accommodate global clients.  
    \item \textbf{Feedback and QA Module:} Designed to close the feedback loop, this module collects structured responses from both clients and employees. It integrates directly with QA testing tools to correlate test outcomes with user satisfaction metrics, enabling data-driven quality improvement. Automated feedback summaries help management identify recurring issues and areas for process optimization.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Design}
The MIS employs a well-structured relational database schema (based on MySQL or PostgreSQL) to manage interconnected data across various modules. Core entities include \texttt{Client}, \texttt{Project}, \texttt{Invoice}, \texttt{Employee}, \texttt{Task}, and \texttt{QAReport}. Referential integrity is maintained using primary and foreign key constraints, ensuring consistency and eliminating redundancy.  

The database follows normalization principles to maintain efficiency and scalability. Relationships such as “one-to-many” between clients and projects or “many-to-many” between employees and tasks are implemented using junction tables. An Entity–Relationship (E–R) diagram visually represents these associations, simplifying database maintenance and future system upgrades.  

Furthermore, indexing and query optimization techniques are used to enhance system performance, especially under heavy workloads. The data model also incorporates version control for audit trails and ensures compliance with international data protection standards.
